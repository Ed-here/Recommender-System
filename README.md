# Recommender-System
This is a project done to study the effect of of popularity bias and its effect coming to the conclusion on how to remove it.
With help of lighfm i used Movies-lens dataset to create a simple recommender system and recommended 20 movies to a random user.
It was found that all the recommended movies was only the top rated ones but with good genere similarity.
By comparing the embedding of the recommended to the longtail ones i recommended 5 movies which have low interaction data.
So at last we have 20 movies in which 5 is long tail.
So in this way i eliminated the popularity bias.
